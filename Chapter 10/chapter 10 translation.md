# 第10章

He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330. He began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge. 

他去了邻近的几个星球：小行星325，326,327,328,329和330。为了增加自己的知识 ，他开始游历这些小行星。

> 这颗星球附近......于是他开始拜访这些星球，好给自己找点事干，也好增长些见识。

The first of them was inhabited by a king. Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic. 

去的第一颗小行星，居住着一位国王。这位国王穿着蓝紫袍子和白色貂皮，他端坐在王座上，看起来简洁宏伟。

> 第一颗小行星上住着一个国王。这个国王身穿紫红镶边白鼬皮长袍，端坐在一张简朴而又气派庄严的王座上。

"Ah! Here is a subject," exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming. 

「哈！来了一个臣民，」国王看到小王子来了，大声叫起来。

And the little prince asked himself: 
"How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before?" 

然后小王子觉得纳闷：
「他以前从来没见过我，怎么会认得我呢？」

He did not know how the world is simplified for kings. To them, all men are subjects. 
"Approach, so that I may see you better," said the king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody. 

他不知道，国王的世界是非常简单的。对国王来说，所有的人都是臣民。「走近一点，让我好好看看你，」国王说，他感觉自己凌驾于人之上，非常地骄傲。

The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent ermine robe. So he remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned. 

小王子朝四周到处看，想找个地方坐下来；但是国王的长袍占满了整个星球，堵塞不堪，所以小王子只好挺直身板站着，因为他太累了，就打起了哈欠。

> 可是整个星球都被那裘华丽丽的白鼬皮长袍占满了。

"It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king," the monarch said to him. "I forbid you to do so." 

「在国王面前打哈欠，不合礼数，」君王对他说。「我禁止你这么做。」

> 「有违宫廷礼仪，」

"I can't help it. I can't stop myself," replied the little prince, thoroughly embarrassed. "I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep..." 

「我控制不住啊，我停不下来，」小王子回答到，非常尴尬。「我长途旅行，都没睡过觉......」

> 「我走了好长的路，一直没睡觉」

"Ah, then," the king said. "I order you to yawn. It is years since I have seen anyone yawning. Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity. Come, now! Yawn again! It is an order." 

「啊，那么，」国王说。「我命令你打哈欠。我好多年没见过人打哈欠了。打哈欠吧，我真的很好奇。来吧，就现在，再打个哈欠！这是命令。」
