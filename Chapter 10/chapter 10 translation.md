# 第10章

He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330. He began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge. 

他去了邻近的几个星球：小行星325，326,327,328,329和330。为了增加自己的知识 ，他开始游历这些小行星。

> 这颗星球附近......于是他开始拜访这些星球，好给自己找点事干，也好增长些见识。

The first of them was inhabited by a king. Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic. 

去的第一颗小行星，居住着一位国王。这位国王穿着蓝紫袍子和白色貂皮，他端坐在王座上，看起来简洁宏伟。

> 第一颗小行星上住着一个国王。这个国王身穿紫红镶边白鼬皮长袍，端坐在一张简朴而又气派庄严的王座上。

"Ah! Here is a subject," exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming. 

「哈！来了一个臣民，」国王看到小王子来了，大声叫起来。

And the little prince asked himself: 
"How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before?" 

然后小王子觉得纳闷：
「他以前从来没见过我，怎么会认得我呢？」

He did not know how the world is simplified for kings. To them, all men are subjects. 
"Approach, so that I may see you better," said the king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody. 

他不知道，国王的世界是非常简单的。对国王来说，所有的人都是臣民。「走近一点，让我好好看看你，」国王说，他感觉自己凌驾于人之上，非常地骄傲。

The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent ermine robe. So he remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned. 

小王子朝四周到处看，想找个地方坐下来；但是国王的长袍占满了整个星球，堵塞不堪，所以小王子只好挺直身板站着，因为他太累了，就打起了哈欠。

> 可是整个星球都被那裘华丽丽的白鼬皮长袍占满了。

"It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king," the monarch said to him. "I forbid you to do so." 

「在国王面前打哈欠，不合礼数，」君王对他说。「我禁止你这么做。」

> 「有违宫廷礼仪，」

"I can't help it. I can't stop myself," replied the little prince, thoroughly embarrassed. "I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep..." 

「我控制不住啊，我停不下来，」小王子回答到，非常尴尬。「我长途旅行，都没睡过觉......」

> 「我走了好长的路，一直没睡觉」

"Ah, then," the king said. "I order you to yawn. It is years since I have seen anyone yawning. Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity. Come, now! Yawn again! It is an order." 

「啊，那么，」国王说。「我命令你打哈欠。我好多年没见过人打哈欠了。打哈欠吧，我真的很好奇。来吧，就现在，再打个哈欠！这是命令。」

"That frightens me... I cannot, any more..." murmured the little prince, now completely abashed. 

「我有点害怕.......打不出...... 」小王子小声说，脸都涨红了。

> 我给吓着了

"Hum! Hum!" replied the king. "Then I-- I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to--" 

「哼！哼！」国王说。「我命令你一会打哈欠，一会儿......」

He sputtered a little, and seemed vexed. 

他说的有点结结巴巴，而且似乎恼了。

> 他嘟嘟囔囔的，看上去不大高兴。

For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected. He tolerated no disobedience. He was an absolute monarch. But, because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable. 

因为国王坚持所有人都应尊重他的权威。他无法忍受有人违抗他的命令。他是个绝对的君王。但是因为他是一个很好的人，他下的命令都通情达理。

> 国王其实是要别人尊重他的权威。
> 
> 他是个专制的君主。

"If I ordered a general," he would say, by way of example, "if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault." 

他会举例说，「如果我命令一名将军把自己变成一只海鸟，这位将军不服从我，那不是这个将军的错。是我的错。」

> 那个将军不服从我，这就不是那个将军的错，是我的错。

"May I sit down?" came now a timid inquiry from the little prince. 

「请问我能坐下吗？」 小王子怯怯地的问。

"I order you to do so," the king answered him, and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle. 

「我命令你坐下，」国王回答，一面庄严的把自己的白貂袍子挪了挪。

>  庄重地挪了挪白鼬皮长袍的下摆。

But the little prince was wondering... The planet was tiny. Over what could this king really rule? 

但是小王子还在思考.......这个星球这么小，国王能统治什么呢？

>  这么小的星球，国王能统治什么呢？

"Sire," he said to him, "I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question--" 

「陛下，」他对国王说，「我恳请您能让我问你一个问题--」

> 请允许我向您提个.......

"I order you to ask me a question," the king hastened to assure him. 

「我命令你问我一个问题，」 国王赶忙向小王子保证。

>  国王赶紧抢着说。

"Sire-- over what do you rule?" 

「陛下，你统治什么呢？」

"Over everything," said the king, with magnificent simplicity. 

「我统治一切，」国王说，威严而简单。

"Over everything?" 

「统治一切？」

The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all the stars. 

国王用手比划了下，指了自己星球，其他的星球，所有的星星。

"Over all that?" asked the little prince. 

「统治所有的星星吗？」小王子问。

>  全归你统治？

"Over all that," the king answered. 

「所有的星星，」国王回答。

For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal. 

他不仅专制，还统治整个宇宙。

> 他不仅是一国的专制君主，还是宇宙的君主。

"And the stars obey you?" 

「所有的星星都服从你？」

"Certainly they do," the king said. "They obey instantly. I do not permit insubordination." 

「当然了，」国王说，「他们即刻就服从我。我不允许有人违抗我。」

> 我一下命令，它们马上就服从。我不能容忍纪律涣散。

Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at. If he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, with out ever having to move his chair. And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor: 

小王子对这样的权力感到惊叹。 他要是掌控这样的绝对权威，就可以看日出了，不是一天44次，而是72次或者100次，也不需要搬动自己的椅子。因为想起了他离开了自己星球，有点难过，他鼓起勇气，请国王帮个忙：

> 这样的权力使小王子惊叹不已。
> 
> 连椅子都不需要挪一挪

"I should like to see a sunset... do me that kindness... Order the sun to set..." 

「我想看一个日落.....请发发善心，帮个忙.....命令太阳下落吧......」

"If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?" the king demanded. "The general, or myself?" 

「如果命令以为将军从一朵花飞到另一朵花儿，像蝴蝶一样，或者写一部悲剧，或把自己变成一只海鸟，将军收到命令，但是无法完成，我们当中谁错了？」国王问到，「是将军，还是我？」

>  这个将军拒不执行命令，是他还是我的错呢？

"You," said the little prince firmly. 

「你错了，」小王子肯定地说。

"Exactly. One much require from each one the duty which each one can perform," the king went on. "Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable." 

「没错。要求别人去做事情，别人要力所能及才行」国王继续说。「要有权威，首先要有理智。如果你命令人去跳海，他们会  反抗闹革命的。我有权要求别人服从我，因为我的命令都很公道。」

> 得让每个人去做他能做到的事情。权威首先得建立在合理的基础上。如果你命令你的老百姓都去投海 ，他们就会造反。我之所以有权让人服从，就是因为我的命令都是合情合理的。

"Then my sunset?" the little prince reminded him: for he never forgot a question once he had asked it. 

「那么，我要的日落呢？」小王子提醒他：小王子提了问题，从未忘记过。

"You shall have your sunset. I shall command it. But, according to my science of government, I shall wait until conditions are favorable." 

「你会看到日落的。我会命令。但是，根据我科学的治理，等到条件有利的时候，我再发出命令。」

> 不过按照我的统治原则，要等到条件成熟的时候。

"When will that be?" inquired the little prince. 

「那会是什么时候呢？」小王子询问到。

"Hum! Hum!" replied the king; and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac. "Hum! Hum! That will be about-- about-- that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight. And you will see how well I am obeyed." 

「哼！哼！」国王翻查一本笨重的年鉴。「哼！哼！还有......有.......8点差20分的时候，夜晚降临。到那时，你将会看到，一切都如此顺从我。」

> 国王先翻看一本厚厚的历书，然后回答说，

> 你会看到它乖乖地服从我的命令的。

The little prince yawned. He was regretting his lost sunset. And then, too, he was already beginning to be a little bored. 

小王子打了个哈欠。他正后悔失去了自己的落日。然后呢，他也开始感到有点无聊了。

> 看不到日落，让他感到挺遗憾。再说他也已经有点腻烦了。

"I have nothing more to do here," he said to the king. "So I shall set out on my way again." 

「我在这里没什么事可做，」他对国王说。「所以我要再次启程了。」

"Do not go," said the king, who was very proud of having a subject. "Do not go. I will make you a Minister!" 

「不要走，」国王说，有一个臣民，他很骄傲。「别走，我认命你为部长！」

>   正骄傲着呢，

"Minister of what?" 

「什么部长？」

"Minster of-- of Justice!" 

「......司法部部长！」

"But there is nobody here to judge!" 

「但是这里没有人需要审判！」

"We do not know that," the king said to him. "I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom. I am very old. There is no room here for a carriage. And it tires me to walk." 

「这个我们就不知道了，」国王对他说。「我还没有巡游完整个国度。我年纪大了。这里放不下一张马车。走路又很累。」

> 这可说不定。我还没巡视过我的王国。我太老了，我没地方放马车，走路又累得慌。

"Oh, but I have looked already!" said the little prince, turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet. On that side, as on this, there was nobody at all... 

「噢！但是我已经看遍了！」小王子说，转身朝这颗小行星的另一边憋了一眼，「那边也没有一个人」

"Then you shall judge yourself," the king answered. "that is the most difficult thing of all. It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom." 

「那你就审判你自己，」国王说。「这是最困难的事了。相比起审判别人，审判自己更加困难。如果你成功的正确审判了自己，那你是一个真正有智慧的人。」

> 审判自己要比审判别人难得多。

"Yes," said the little prince, "but I can judge myself anywhere. I do not need to live on this planet. 

「是的，」小王子说，「但是我在哪儿都可以审判自己。我不用一直在这个星球上啊。」

"Hum! Hum!" said the king. "I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat. I hear him at night. You can judge this old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. Thus his life will depend on your justice. But you will pardon him on each occasion; for he must be treated thriftily. He is the only one we have." 

「嗯哼！」国王说。「我确定，这个星球上有个地方，有一只年老的老鼠。晚上能听到他的声音。你可以审判这只上了年纪的老鼠。时不时的判处他死刑。这样一来，他的生命就全靠你的公正了。但是你可以每次都赦免他，我们只有这一只，可要省着点用。」

> 我想哪，在我的星球上有只老耗子，夜里我听见它的声音。你可以审判这只老耗子。

> 这样啊，他的生命就取决于你的判决了。不过，这只耗子你得悠着点儿用，每次判决后都得赦免它。因为只有这么一只耗子。

"I," replied the little prince, "do not like to condemn anyone to death. And now I think I will go on my way." 

「我，」小王子回答，「我不喜欢判任何人死。我想我要继续我的旅途了。」

"No," said the king. 

「别走，」国王说。
But the little prince, having now completed his preparations for departure, had no wish to grieve the old monarch. 

小王子已经准备好了离开，但是他不想让老国王伤心。

"If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed," he said, "he should be able to give me a reasonable order. He should be able, for example, to order me to be gone by the end of one minute. It seems to me that conditions are favorable..." 

「陛下，如果要我立刻服从你，」他说，「应该给我下个合理的命令。比如，命令我一分钟之内离开。这些条件是有利于我的.......」

> 那就不妨下一道合情合理的命令。比如说，陛下可以命令我在一分钟内离开此地。我觉得条件已经成熟......

As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment. Then, with a sigh, he took his leave. 

国王没有回答，小王子犹豫了一会，然后，叹了口气，动身离开。

>  国王一声不吭

"I made you my Ambassador," the king called out, hastily. 
He had a magnificent air of authority. 

「我让你做我的大使，」国王仓促的喊道，庄重而权威。

> 我认命你当我的大使。这时国王赶紧喊道，他的神态威严极了。

"The grown-ups are very strange," the little prince said to himself, as he continued on his journey.

「大人真的很奇怪，」小王子自言自语着继续他的旅途。

> 「这些大人真奇怪。」小王子在旅途中自言自语地说。
