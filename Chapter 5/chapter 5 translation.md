As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince's planet, his departure from it, his journey. The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the baobabs.

每天我都和小王子聊天，然后了解一些情况，或是关于他的星球，或是他为什么离开那儿，或是他的星际旅程。这些信息，都是一点一点，碰运气知道的。就这样，在第三天，我知道了猴面包树的悲剧。

This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little prince asked me abruptly-- as if seized by a grave doubt-- "It is true, isn't it, that sheep eat little bushes?"

这次，我又要感谢小羊了。小王子突然开口问，好像疑虑深重：小羊当真吃灌木丛吧？

"Yes, that is true."

是的，没错

"Ah! I am glad!"

哈！这我就放心啦！

I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little prince added:

我不懂，小羊吃灌木，为什么这样重要。但是小王子，接着说：

"Then it follows that they also eat baobabs?"

那这样的话，他们也吃猴面包树吗?

I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab.

我告诉小王子，猴面包树并不是小灌木丛，而是跟城堡一样高大的树木。他就是带来一群大象，也吃不完一颗猴面包树。

The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.

我说到一群大象，小王子哈哈笑了。

"We would have to put them one on top of the other," he said.

我们可以让大象叠罗汉，他说。

But he made a wise comment:

但是他很明智的

"Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little."

猴面包树长大之前，都是小树苗啊。

"That is strictly correct," I said. "But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?"

这非常正确. 我说。“但是为什么你要小羊吃掉猴面包树呢？”

He answered me at once, "Oh, come, come!", as if he were speaking of something that was self-evident. And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance.

他只回了我一句“来吧来吧！”好像他说的是一件显而易见的事。我要自个儿搞清楚这件事情，还着实得动一番脑筋呢。

Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived-- as on all planets-- good plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken. Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin-- timidly at first-- to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun. If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.

我知道，所有的星球上都长着好植物和坏植物，小王子的星球也一样。结果呢，好植物有好种子，坏植物有坏种子。可种子是看不到的，他们在漆黑的地下沉睡着，直到其中一颗想要醒来。然后呢，这颗小小的种子舒展身子，伸出一颗柔和的小树苗，羞怯怯的朝着太阳去了。要是萝卜或是玫瑰花丛的幼苗，他们想往哪儿长，就往哪儿长。可要是坏植物，一认出就得拔掉。

Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested with them. A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over the entire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces…

现在小王子的星球上，有许多可怕的种子--就是猴面包树种子，它遍布星球的土壤。你要是动手晚了，就别想除掉它，它会占满整个星球，它的根系将星球钻开，四处蔓延。要是猴面包树太多，星球又太小，它们会将星球撑开，撑的四分五裂。

"It is a question of discipline," the little prince said to me later on. "When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work," the little prince added, "but very easy."

“这得有个严格的约束。” 后来小王子对我说。 “早上你自己洗漱完了，就该给你的星球洗一下了，你得万分仔细的给它洗漱。猴面包树小时候，和玫瑰花很相像。一旦分清了哪儿是玫瑰花，哪儿是猴面包树，就马上把猴面包树拔掉。这个工作单调枯燥，不过很容易。”

And one day he said to me: "You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day. Sometimes," he added, "there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes…"

有一天，他对我说：“你真该好好画一幅画，让你那儿的孩子也能看到这一切。要是他们哪天出门旅行，你的画会就派上用场了。有时候，” 他接着说，“把一件工作推到第二天，也没什么害处。但如果和猴面包树有关，那通常意味着灾难。我知道有一个星球住着一个懒人。星球上长了三株幼苗，他也不管...”

So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve. "Children," I say plainly, "watch out for the baobabs!"

就这样，在小王子的描述下，我画了那颗星球。我实在不喜欢用道德家的口吻，只是很少人知道猴面包树的危害。任何人要是在小行星上走丢了，都会面临巨大的风险。于是这一次，我破例打破含蓄。“孩子们，” 我说的直接了当，“当心猴面包树啊！”

My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing. The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me.

 为了我的朋友们，我画的格外卖力，他们和我一样，完全不知道身边长久潜伏着这种危险。要让大家都知道这件事，我再麻烦都是值得的。


Perhaps you will ask me, "Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?"

也许你会问我，“猴面包树这幅画最是壮观美丽，其他任何一副都比不了。这是为什么？”

The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity.

答案很简单。我尽力尝试了。但其他的都失败了。画猴面包树事出紧急，很是必要，这些都化作我的灵感了。
