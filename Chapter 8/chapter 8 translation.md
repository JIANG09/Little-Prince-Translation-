I soon learned to know this flower better. On the little prince's planet the flowers had always been very simple. They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody. One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet. It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab.

我很快就对这朵花有了更多的了解。在小王子的星球上，生长着很简单的花儿。这些花儿只有一层花瓣，不占地方，也不妨碍任何人。某个早晨他们在草丛中绽放，一到晚上又都悄悄凋谢了。但是有一天，不知从哪儿飘来一粒种子，一朵新的花儿长出来了。小王子仔细的观察这颗小苗，它和别的小苗都不一样。你想啊，它说不定是猴面包树的幼苗呢。

The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it. But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She chose her colors with the greatest care. She adjusted her petals one by one. She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies. It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear. Oh, yes! She was a coquettish creature! And her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days.

这颗小苗很快就不再长大，做好了开花的准备。小王子看他长出了一个很大的花蕾，感觉不可思议的幻影即将显现。花儿在绿色的卧房里打扮的很美丽，但它并不满足。她精挑细选自己的颜色，一片一片整理花瓣。她可不想跟田野里的罂粟花一样，乱蓬蓬皱兮兮的来到世界上。她希望自己美丽无比，光彩照人的来到这个世界上。噢，就是这样！她是如此娇媚！一天又一天，她就这样打扮自己，神神秘秘。

> 小王子眼看着它长出一个很大很大的花蕾，心想花蕾绽放开来一定很奇妙。可是这朵花儿待在绿色的花萼里面，磨磨蹭蹭地打扮个没完。
>
> 她要让自己美艳照人地来到世间。

Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself.

一天早晨，刚好日出，她忽然露出面孔。

And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said:

经过了这般精心费神的打扮，她伸了个懒腰，说：

"Ah! I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still all disarranged…"

喔！我还是半睡半醒的。请你原谅。我的花瓣还是凌乱.......

But the little prince could not restrain his admiration:

 但是小王子情不自禁地赞美：
 
"Oh! How beautiful you are!"

哇！你真美！

"Am I not?" the flower responded, sweetly. "And I was born at the same moment as the sun…"

 可不是吗？花儿甜美的回应他。“我和太阳一同出生的嘛....”

> 花儿柔声答道

The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest-- but how moving-- and exciting-- she was!

小王子很容易感到，她一点儿也不谦虚--但她实在太动人太令人欣喜了！

"I think it is time for breakfast," she added an instant later. "If you would have the kindness to think of my needs--"

“我想，现在该用早餐了，” 过了一会她说到。“如果你有好意，想想我需要什么 ---”

And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower.

小王子很不好意思，去打来一壶清水。然后，他照料花儿。

> 于是就打来一壶清水，给这朵花儿浇水。

So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity-- which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:

花儿有虚荣心，很快就让小王子痛苦不堪，难以应对。比如，有一天，花儿说起它的四根刺，她对小王子说：

> 很快就把他折磨的够呛。

"Let the tigers come with their claws!"

那些老虎，让它们张着爪子来好了！

"There are no tigers on my planet," the little prince objected. "And, anyway, tigers do not eat weeds."

“我的星球上没有老虎，” 小王子反对说，“而且，老虎也不吃草啊。”

"I am not a weed," the flower replied, sweetly.

“我不是草，” 花儿温柔的回答。

"Please excuse me…"

“对不起......”

"I am not at all afraid of tigers," she went on, "but I have a horror of drafts. I suppose you wouldn't have a screen for me?"

“我一点儿也不怕老虎，” 它继续说，“但我怕风，我想你这里没有风障把？”

"A horror of drafts-- that is bad luck, for a plant," remarked the little prince, and added to himself, "This flower is a very complex creature…"

“害怕风，一颗植物这样子，可惨了。” 小王子自言自语说，“花儿真是难以琢磨 .......”

"At night I want you to put me under a glass globe. It is very cold where you live. In the place I came from--"

“晚上，我想你把我放到玻璃圆罩里。你这儿太冷了。我那儿--”

But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed. She could not have known anything of any other worlds. Embarassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a na飗e untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.

说到这她停住了。她来的时候是颗种子， 不知道别的世界是怎么样的。她说的谎，这么不高明，她又羞又恼，就咳嗽了两三身，想让小王子觉得理亏：

> 让人发现她说的谎这么不高明

"The screen?"

“风障呢？”

"I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me…"

“你跟我说话那会儿，我正要去找.......”

Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same.

于是她咳的更重了些，好让他感到更加懊悔。

So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy.

小王子真心真意喜欢这朵花，可还是很快起了疑心。那些无关紧要的话，他太当真了，搞的自己很不开心。

> 他对那些无关紧要的话太当真了，结果自己很苦恼。

"I ought not to have listened to her," he confided to me one day. "One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace. This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity."

“我不该听她说什么，” 一天他向我吐露真心。“从来就不该听花儿的。只要看看他们，闻闻花香，就够了。我的星球上，花香弥漫。我却不懂享受 她的优雅。那个爪子的故事，让我久久心神不安。其实心里该充满温柔和同情。”

> 其实我该同情她才是

> 有一天他对我说了了心里话。“花儿说的话，是听不得的。花儿是让人看，让人闻的。这朵花儿让我的星球芳香四溢，我却不会享受这快乐。”

And he continued his confidences:

他还说:

"The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything! I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her… I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little strategems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her…"

“我什么也不懂！看她这个人，应该看她做了什么，而不是说了什么。她带给我芳香，带给我光彩。我不该从她身边逃走......我本该猜到，她那笨拙的小诡计背后，是她的爱。花儿总是自相矛盾！可惜我太年轻，还不懂如何去爱她......”

>  我当时什么也不懂！ 看她这个人，应该看她做什么，而不是听她说什么。我真不该逃走！我本该猜到她那小小花招背后的一片柔情。花儿总是这么表里不一！可惜当时我太年轻，还不懂得怎么去爱她。
