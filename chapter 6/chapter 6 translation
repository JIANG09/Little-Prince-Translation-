Oh, little prince! Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life… For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset. I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, w hen you said to me:

嗳，小王子啊！我一点点的知道了你那段悲伤的生活。很长一段时间，你只喜欢安安静静的看看落日。这个新的细节我是在第四天早晨知道的，当时你对我说：

> 长期以来，你生活中的唯一乐趣，就是坐在那里观看落日的柔美余晖。我得知这一新的细节，是在相识后第四天的早晨。当时，你对我说：

"I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now."

“我好喜欢看落日。走，我们去看落日吧。”

"But we must wait," I said.

“不过我们还要等等，” 我说。

"Wait? For what?"

“等等？为什么？”

"For the sunset. We must wait until it is time."

“我们要等太阳落下。”

At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. You said to me:

刚开始，你满脸惊讶，继而自个儿笑了起来。你对我说:

"I am always thinking that I am at home!"

“我老以为自己在家呢！”

Just so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France.

可不，大家都知道，美国的中午，在法国正是黄昏。

If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon. Unfortunately, France is too far away for that. But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your chair a few steps. You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like…

要是能一分钟飞到法国，就马上看到黄昏。可惜了，法国太远了。但是在你的小小星球上，我的小王子，你只需将椅子挪动几步就行了。你一天什么时候想看落日都行....

"One day," you said to me, "I saw the sunset forty-four times!"

“有一天，我看了43次落日呢!”

And a little later you added:

过了一小会儿， 你又说：

"You know-- one loves the sunset, when one is so sad…"

“你知道的，一个人感到非常难过悲伤的时候，就爱看日落......”

"Were you so sad, then?" I asked, "on the day of the forty-four sunsets?"

“这么说，就是看43次落日那天，你感到非常悲伤啰?”

But the little prince made no reply.

但小王子没问话。
