# Chapter 3 
很久以后，我才弄清楚他从哪儿来的。这位小王子，问了我很多问题，而对我问他的问题总像没听见似的。他无意中吐露了一些话，我拼拼凑凑，终于弄明白这一切。比如，他第一次看见我的飞机（我就不画自己的飞机了，对我来说，这样的画实在太复杂了。），就问我：“这是什么东西？”

It took me a long time to learn where he come from. This little prince,who asked me so many questions, never seem to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me. The fisrt time he saw my airplane (I shall not draw my plane,that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me: What is that object?

 “这不是什么东西。它能在天上飞来飞去。这是一架飞机，我的飞机。”我很自豪的讲给他听，自己能飞上天。
 
It is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane. 

And I was very proud to have him learn that I can fly. 

他听了大声问：“什么？你从天上跌下来了？

He cried out, then: What? You droped down from the sky？

“是的。”我谦逊的回答到。

Yes. I answered modestly. 

“喔！这可真有趣！”

“Oh! This is funny!”

然后小王子发出一阵清脆的笑声，这下我可恼了。我希望别人能认真严肃的看待自己的不幸。

And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously. 

Then he added: so you, too, come from the sky. Which is your planet?

他出现的神秘，我一直没搞明白。但就在这一刹那，我脑子里灵光一闪，摸到一丝线索。我突如其来地问：“你是从别的星球来的啦？”

At that moment I caught a gleam of light of his impenetrable mystery of his presence;and I demanded, abruptly, “do you come from another planet?”

可他没有回答。他轻轻的抬起头，眼神依然停驻在我的飞机上。
But he didn't reply. He tossed gently, without taking his eyes from  my planet. 

“可不是么，乘着它来，你来的地方不会太远。”说完他陷入遐想中，很久才回过神来。接着，他从口袋里掏出我画的小羊，看着自己的宝贝，又沉浸入神思中。

It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away. 

And he sank into reverie which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure. 

你想想看，才提到“别的星球”就打住了，我的好奇涌上心头，伤筋费神，竭力想了解他更多。

You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the “other plantes”. I made a great effort, therefore, tofind out more on this subject.

“你从哪里来？我的小家伙。刚才你说到你那儿，那是什么地方？你要把你的小羊带到哪儿去？”

My little man, where do you come from? . What is this “where I live”,of which you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?

还是没有回答，他安安静静的，沉思了一阵。然后说：“你送我了一只盒子，这就好了，夜晚小羊有屋子住了。”

After a reflective silence he answered: The thing is so good about the box you have given me is tha at night the sheep can use it as his house.”

“那是。如果你听话，我还会给你根绳子，白天可以拴着他；还可以加根杆子。”

That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string,too,so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to. 

小王子一听，一震一惊，“拴住他！多么奇怪的想法！”

The little prince seemed shocked by this offer：Tie him! What a queer idea!

“可要是不拴住小羊，它会四处跑，然后跑丢的。”

But if you don’t tie him,I said, he will wander off somewhere and get lost.

我的朋友笑的像银铃一样：“你叫他跑哪儿去？”

My friend broke out another peal of laughter: where do you think he would go?

“哪儿都可以啊。往前一直跑．．”

Anywhere. Straight ahead of him.

小王子诚恳的说：“这倒是没事。我那里，所有东西都很小。”

Little prince said earnestly: That doesn’t matter. Where I live, everything is so small! 

紧接着，他又说道：“就是往前一直跑，也不能跑多远．．．” 语气中仿佛带着一丝忧伤。
And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added: straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far.
