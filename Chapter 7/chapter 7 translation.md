On the fifth day-- again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep-- the secret of the little prince's life was revealed to me. Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on his problem, he demanded:

第五天，还是羊的事情，让我知道了小王子生活的秘密。他好像有个问题默默思索了很久，突然问我：

"A sheep-- if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, too?"

“羊既然吃灌木，那它也吃花吗？”

"A sheep," I answered, "eats anything it finds in its reach."

“它碰到什么就吃什么。”

"Even flowers that have thorns?"

“带刺的花也吃吗？”

> 连有刺的花儿也吃？

"Yes, even flowers that have thorns."

“是的，带刺的也吃。”

"Then the thorns-- what use are they?"

“那么，刺有什么用呢？”

I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.

我也不知道。那时，我正忙着拧下一个卡在发动机里的螺钉。我非常着急，因为我清楚的认识到，飞机故障极其严重。饮用水只剩一点，我不得不担心起最坏的情况。

> 我发现故障似乎很严重 ，饮用水也快完了。 我担心会发生最坏的情况，心里很着急。

"The thorns-- what use are they?"

“那么，刺有什么用呢？”

The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me, I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my head:

小王子只要提问题，从不放弃。但是我正烦躁的处理那个螺钉，所以我想到什么就答什么：

> 小王子只要提了一个问题，就不依不饶地要得到答案。而那个螺钉正弄得我很恼火，我就随口回答了一句： 

"The thorns are of no use at all. Flowers have thorns just for spite!"

“刺嘛，没什么用处，就是花在作怪呗！”

>  刺嘛，什么用都没有，纯粹是花想使坏呗！

"Oh!"

“喔！”

There was a moment of complete silence. Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness:

沉默了一阵子后，小王子看着我，忿忿然地说：

"I don't believe you! Flowers are weak creatures. They are nae. They reassure themselves as best they can. They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons…"

“我不信你的话！花朵是纤弱的、天真的。它们想尽量保护自己。它们以为刺是厉害的武器......”

I did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself: "If this bolt still won't turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer." Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts.

我没做声。当时我对自己说：“要还拧不动这个螺钉，就用锤子敲下来。” 又一次，小王子打断我的思路。

"And you actually believe that the flowers--"

“你真的认为花儿......”

"Oh, no!" I cried. "No, no no! I don't believe anything. I answered you with the first thing that came into my head. Don't you see-- I am very busy with matters of consequence!"

“噢！不！” 我大喊起来。“不，不，不！我什么都不认为。我想起什么，就说什么。你看--我正忙着干正事！”

He stared at me, thunderstruck.

他盯着我，如同被雷击一样。

"Matters of consequence!"

“正事！”

He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine-grease, bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly…

他见我手握锤子，指头沾满了漆黑的机油，弯下腰对着一个他觉得奇丑无比的物体......

"You talk just like the grown-ups!"

“你说话就像那些大人！”

That made me a little ashamed. But he went on, relentlessly:

这让我有点羞愧。但他继续毫不留情面的说：

"You mix everything up together… You confuse everything…"

“你把什么都搅在一起....你什么都分不清...”

He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.

他真的气极了，一头金发在微风中摇曳。

"I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He has never smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has never loved any one. He has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And all day he says over and over, just like you: 'I am busy with matters of consequence!' And that makes him swell up with pride. But he is not a man-- he is a mushroom!"

“我知道有一个星球，住着一个红脸先生。他从没闻过花香，从没望过星星。他从没爱过一个人。他这辈子只做一件事：做算术。每天，他一遍遍说的和你一样‘我正忙正事呢。’ 这让他骄傲、膨胀。但他不算一个人--他是朵蘑菇。”

> “我到过一个星球，上面住着一个红脸先生。他从没闻过花香。他从没望过星星。他从没爱过一个人。除了算账，他什么事也没做过。他成天像你一样说个没完：‘我有正事要干！我有正事要干！’ 变得骄气十足。可是这算不得一个人，他是个蘑菇。”

"A what?"

“是什么？”

"A mushroom!"

“一个蘑菇!”

The little prince was now white with rage.

小王子脸都气白了。

>   小王子这会儿气的脸色发白了。

"The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years. For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important? Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman's sums? And if I know-- I, myself-- one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is doing-- Oh! You think that is not important!"

“几百年来，花儿都长刺的。几百年来，羊一直都吃花儿的。为什么花儿费那么多劲长出刺，但是没一点用？弄清楚这事难道不重要吗？羊和花儿的战争难道不是正事吗？这难道不比红脸胖先生的算账重要？而且如果我认识一朵花儿，独一无二，就长在我的星球上。哪天早晨，小羊甚至都不知道自己在干什么，就一口吃掉了它。噢！你觉得这件事不重要吗！”

> #### 周克希翻译
> “几百万年以前，花儿就长刺了。可几百万年以前，羊也早就开始吃花儿了。刺什么用也没有，那花儿为什么要费那份劲去长刺呢？把这弄明白难道不是正事吗？绵羊和花儿的战争难道不重要吗？这难道不比那个胖子红脸先生的算账更重要，更是正事吗？还有，如果我认识一朵世上独一无二的花儿，除了我的星球，哪儿都找不到这样的花儿，而有天早上，一只小羊甚至都不明白自己在做什么，就一口把花儿吃掉了，这难道不重要吗！”

His face turned from white to red as he continued:

他的脸白色褪去，红了起来，接着又往下说：

"If some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars. He can say to himself, 'Somewhere, my flower is there…' But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened… And you think that is not important!"

“如果一个人爱上一朵花，就像千万颗星星上，只有一颗上长着一朵花。只要看一眼星星，就足以让他快乐。他会对自己说 ‘在那么一个地方，我的花就长在那儿’  要是花被羊吃掉了，所有的星星将瞬间光辉黯淡。你还认为这不重要！”

> #### 周克希翻译
> 如果有个人爱上一朵花儿，好几百万好几百万颗星星中间，只有 一颗上面长着这朵花儿，那他只要望着许许多多星星，就会感到很幸福。 他对自己说‘羊吃掉了这朵花，这对他来说，就好像满天的星星突然一下子都熄灭了！这难道不重要吗！

> #### 柳鸣九
> 如果有谁喜欢的那朵花儿，在千万颗星星中只此一朵，那么，他看着花儿的时候，自然会感到无比幸福。他会对自己说：‘我的那朵花儿在那边的什么地方呢......’  但是，如果绵羊单把这花儿吃掉了，那对他来说，就如同所有的星星顷刻之间都熄灭啦！这样的事情难道还不严重吗？

He could not say anything more. His words were choked by sobbing.

他一句话也说不下去了。他抽抽噎噎的哭泣起来。

The night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him:

夜晚降临了。我放下手中的工具。锤子啊，螺钉啊，口渴啊，死亡啊，我全部抛在脑后。在一颗星星上，在我生活的行星上，在地球上，有一位小王子需要安慰。我抱他入怀，摇抚着他 ，对他说：

"The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep. I will draw you a railing to put around your flower. I will--"

“你爱的那朵花安全着呢，我再给羊画个口套，在花的周围画上栅栏。我还会......”

> 你爱的那朵花儿不会有危险的......我会给你的绵羊画一只嘴罩.....我会给你的花儿画一个护栏......我......

I did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering. I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more.

我不知道对他说什么好。我觉得自己笨拙尴尬。我不知道怎样接近他，打动他，再次与他亲密无间。

It is such a secret place, the land of tears.

泪流过的土地，是怎样神秘的地方啊。
