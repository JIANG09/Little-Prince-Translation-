#  第9章

I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds. On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order. He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes. He possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning. He also had one volcano that was extinct. But, as he said, "One never knows!" So he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too. If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions. Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney. 

我想他是借着群鸟迁徙逃走的。离开的那个早晨，他把星球收拾的井井有条。他仔细的清理他的活火山。他有两个活火山，方便早上热早餐。他还有个熄灭了的火山，但是他说，“世事难料！” 然后把死火山那儿打扫干净。要是打扫干净，这些火山就不会喷发，只会缓慢稳定地燃烧。火山爆发，就像烟囱喷出火花。

> 我想他是趁野鸟迁徙的机会出走的。动身的那天早晨，他把星球收拾的井井有条。他仔细地疏通了活火山。星球上有两个活火山，热早餐很方便。还有一座死火山。不过，正像他所说的：“谁说的准呢！”  所以这座死火山照样要疏通。火山疏通过了，就会缓缓地、均匀地燃烧，不会喷发。火山喷发跟烟囱冒火是一样的。

On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes. That is why they bring no end of trouble upon us. 
The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the last little shoots of the baobabs. He believed that he would never want to return. But on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him. And when he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realized that he was very close to tears. 

在地球上，我们人实在太小了，没法疏通我们的火山。所以火山带给我们无穷无尽的烦恼。小王子猴面包树的根拔掉了，他很沮丧。他觉得自己不会再回来了。最后这个早晨，所有熟悉的任务对他来说都很珍贵。他最后一次给花儿角浇水，准备把她放在玻璃罩子里面时，他感到自己快哭了。

> 它们造成那么多麻烦，就是由于这个缘故。小王子还拔掉了刚长出来的几株猴面包树幼苗。他心情有点忧郁，心想这一走就再也回不来了。所有这些习惯的活儿，这天早上都显得格外亲切。而当他最后一次给花儿浇水，准备给她盖上罩子的时候，他只觉得想哭。

"Goodbye," he said to the flower. 

「再见，」他对花儿说。

But she made no answer. 

但是花儿没有回答。

"Goodbye," he said again. 

「再见了，」他又说了一遍。

The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold. 

花儿咳嗽了一声。但不是因为她感冒了。

"I have been silly," she said to him, at last. "I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy..." 

「我一直都很傻，」 她终于对他说。「请原谅我。试着变得快乐......」

>  「我以前太傻了，」她终于开口了。「请你原谅我。但愿你能幸福。」

He was surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness. 

花儿没有责备他，他很惊讶。他站在那儿，不知所措，手里拿着玻璃罩子，停在半空中。他不明白她怎么突然变得温柔恬静。

> 他感到吃惊的是，居然没有一声责备。他举着罩子，茫然不知所措地站在那儿。他不懂这般恬淡的表情。

"Of course I love you," the flower said to him. "It is my fault that you have not known it all the while. That is of no importance. But you-- you have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy... let the glass globe be. I don't want it any more." 

「当然，我爱你，」花儿对他说。「你一直都不知道，这真是我的错。这倒不重要。但是你--你和我一样，都很愚蠢。试着快乐起来......把玻璃罩子拿走吧。我不再需要了。」

> 「是的，我爱你，」 花儿对他说，「但由于我的过错，你一点儿也没领会。这没什么要紧。不过你也和我一样傻。但愿你能幸福......把这罩子放一边吧，我用不着它了。」

"But the wind--" 

「可是有风--」

"My cold is not so bad as all that... the cool night air will do me good. I am a flower." 

「我的感冒没那么糟糕.......晚风凉凉的，对我有好处。我是一朵花儿。」

"But the animals--" 

「可还有动物--」

"Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems that they are very beautiful. And if not the butterflies-- and the caterpillars-- who will call upon me? You will be far away... as for the large animals-- I am not at all afraid of any of them. I have my claws." 

「要是我想和蝴蝶做朋友，就应该受得了一两只毛毛虫。蝴蝶好像真的很美丽。要是没有蝴蝶和毛毛虫，谁会来看我呢？你将要去很远很远的地方......至于庞大的动物，我一点儿而不害怕他们。我有自己的刺。 」

> 「我既然想认识蝴蝶，就应该受得了两三条毛毛虫。蝴蝶很美丽。要不然有谁来看我呢？你，你到时候已经走得远远的了。至于野兽，我根本不怕。我也有爪子。」

And, na飗ely, she showed her four thorns. Then she added: 
"Don't linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go!" 
For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower...

然后，她展示了自己的四根刺，还是那么天真烂漫。然后又说：「别这样徘徊不定了。你已经决定要离开了。现在就走吧！」
因为她不想让他看见自己哭泣，她是一朵多么骄傲的花儿......

 > 随后她又说：「别磨磨蹭蹭的。已经决定要走了。那就走吧。」因为她不愿意让他看见自己流泪。她是一朵如此骄傲的花儿......
